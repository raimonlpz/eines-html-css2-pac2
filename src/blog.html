                    The term "trap" refers to places where drug deals take place.
                    Other topics also include street life, acquiring wealth, violence, American vehicles,
                    and life experiences that artists have faced.

                    Trap music employs multilayered thin- or thick-textured monophonic drones with
                    sometimes a melodic accompaniment expressed with synthesizers; crisp, grimy,
                    and rhythmic snares, deep 808 kick drums, double-time, triple-time, and
                    similarly divided hi-hats, and a cinematic and symphonic use of string, brass, woodwind,
                    and keyboard instruments to create an energetic, hard-hitting, deep, and variant atmosphere.

                            Early producers creating trap music included Lil Jon from Atlanta,
                            Georgia, where the term originated as a reference to places where drug
                            deals are made, who along with Mannie Fresh from New Orleans and DJ Paul
                            from Memphis, Tennessee worked with local acts in Atlanta.

                            During the early- to mid-2000s, trap music began to emerge as a recognized
                            genre after the mainstream success of a number of albums and singles with
                            lyrics that covered life in "the trap", drug dealing and the struggle for success.

                            In May 2015, trap music once again surfaced to the top of mainstream
                            music charts as New Jersey rapper Fetty Wap's hit single "Trap Queen"
                            peaked at number two on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart.

                        In 2015, a new fusion of trap music named as "Latin trap" began to emerge.
                        Latin trap is similar to mainstream trap which details "'la calle', or the
                        streets—hustling, sex, and drugs...
                        Prominent artists of Latin trap include Bryant Myers, Anuel AA, Miky Woodz,
                        Almighty, Maluma and Bad Bunny.

                    Billboard music charts with a number of records released by rappers such as Young Jeezy,
                    Chief Keef and Future.
